I first remember using a computer aged three. My dad brought home a Commodore PET from the school where he worked and we spent many happy hours together writing software for it. I was hooked on computers and technology from there on in.

In school, I was the one who was 'good at computers'. I spent my rainy weekends writing code for ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes. 

I have a degree in Computer Science and a second degree in Law. I’ve recently  started on another degree in Applied Data Science. 

I am a UK licensed radio amateur and speak on air as MW0KKR. I play drums and guitar. I’ve built a rock climbing wall in my garage, and a music studio in my home office.

I write code for work, for my degree and for fun. I welcome comments, pull requests and issues! If you find anything I've published here useful, let me know. If it's broken, also let me know. :-)
